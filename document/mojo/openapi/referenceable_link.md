| `mojo.openapi.Reference` |  | A simple object to allow referencing other components in the specification, internally and externally. |
| `mojo.openapi.Link` |  | The Link object represents a possible design-time link for a response. The presence of a link does not guarantee the caller's ability to successfully invoke it, rather it provides a known relationship and traversal mechanism between responses and other operations. |
